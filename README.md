# DAS_sensitivity
Jupyter Notebook to assess DAS sensitivity to seismic waves, based on 3D sensitivity equations (dip and azimuth) in a ray-based approach.
Code used in paper : 

## STEPS
1) Create travel time grid for all sensor using Pykonal
2) Get sensitivity to a source
   
## known difficulties 
If on windows Pykonal might not work from first try.
solution :
